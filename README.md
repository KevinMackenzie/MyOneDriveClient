This simple sample demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) to get an access token and call the Microsoft Graph (using OAuth 2.0 against the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint).

## Steps to Run

You can get full explaination about this sample, and build it from scratch by going to [Windows desktop .NET guided walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-mobileanddesktopapp-windowsdesktop-intro).

If you just want to quickly run it, use the following instructions:

1. Register an Azure AD v2.0 (converged) app. 
    - Navigate to the [App Registration Portal](https://identity.microsoft.com). 
    - Go to the the `My Apps` page, click `Add an App`, and name your app.  
    - Set a platform by clicking `Add Platform`, select `Native`.
    - Copy to the clipboard your Application Id

2. Clone the code.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2.git
  ```

3. In the `App.xaml.cs` file, set your application/client id copied from the App Registration Portal.

    ``private static string ClientId = "[Application Id pasted from the application registration portal]"``

4. Run the application from Visual Studio (Debug | Start without Debugging)
