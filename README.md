# Welcome to This Project!  (We still need a name!)
## Purpose
The OneDrive client that is built into windows isn't very good and since it's built into windows, it isn't easy to fix it if its not working!  This application solves that problem by being stand-alone and open source, but that's just the beginning.  This will also support mutiple different providers of cloud storage.  While OneDrive is the only one right now for testing, the Plugin system allows any provider to have support.  Another feature will be to allow encryption of data when uploading it to ease the users wary of the security and privacy of storing their data on some company's server.

## Where we (I) am at now / Future plans
After working on this for a few months, I am developing a new structure for the application to hopefully be more robust and modular.  Much of the current code will be reused, but the way it is all connected will probably change.  I may submit a proposal for the Spring 2017 semester for this to become an RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) Project so I can get an initial base of contributors.

## Contributing
At this time, I am the only contributer on this project and since it is undergoing major changes, pull requests will probably not be accepted.  Suggestions on structure (in the wiki) can be made as issues and I'd love to hear them.
