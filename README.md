# Welcome to This Project!  (We still need a name!)
## Purpose
The OneDrive client that is built into windows isn't very good and since it's built into windows, it isn't easy to fix it if its not working!  This application solves that problem by being stand-alone and open source, but that's just the beginning.  This will also support mutiple different providers of cloud storage.  While OneDrive is the only one right now for testing, the Plugin system allows any provider to have support.  Another feature will be to allow encryption of data when uploading it to ease the users wary of the security and privacy of storing their data on some company's server.

## Where we (I) am at now / Future plans
After working on this for a few months, I am developing a new structure for the application to hopefully be more robust and modular. Future work on this project will be done in another repository (not yet created) since a full rewrite will be done due to such a large structural change.  See https://docs.google.com/document/d/12du6jhgV2ifR7IV8nfTaC20sdfsx8A39oGmF1N-Diu0/edit?usp=sharing for a WIP outline of the new structure.  I may do a full set of UML diagrams before going into code.

## Contributing
At this time, I am the only contributer on this project and since it is undergoing major changes.  Suggestions on structure (see linkn above) can be made as issues and I'd love to hear them.
